This project is a fictional e-commerce Website for a sustainable food and clothing company. People looking for local, ethical and sustainable clothes or food products can view the site on all types of devices, where they can learn more and also order products and create a user account to check order history and update and save contact info. The site is fully responsive and accessible.

## User Stories Evaluation
To ensure that the project fulfils the goals set out in the user stories:
  ### Site User Stories
  1. As a site user I can understand the purpose of the site so that I can learn more about the business with ease.
    * Once in the site the user is welcomed with an attractive and easy to navigate landing page with a fuctional Nav bar which takes them to the other pages of the site. The Hero Image holds an inspirational quote and a call to action button to book an appoointment straight away. The name of the councellor is easy to see in the top left hand corner. The user is also able to navigate from all pages to the councellors social media sites.  The user can click on the about services or contact tab in the nav bar to learn more about the business.

     * The User can easily book an appointment with the councellor by clicking on the book tab in the nav bar or the call to action button on the Home or About pages. This will take them to the sign in page where they either can sign in using existing details or sign up for an account using the link (sign up) above the sign in form. They can only book an appointment if they're a registered user. The register link in the nav bar takes them to the sign up form and the log in link in the nav bar takes them to the sign in form as well. Once signed up or signed in the user is redirected back to the Home page where the Login and Register Links are replaced with Logout and Logged in as (username) There's also an new link called My appointments.

 # Credits 

 * Code Institutes two walk through projects were used as a base to build my own project. The 'Hello Django walkthrough' helped me to understand and build the CRUD fuctionalities and 'I think therefore I blog' helped me to understand and build the authentication and message fuctionality.

 * I looked at and used images from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/)

 * I used [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp) and [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) for Problems with code syntax and functionality. I found alot of good answers there.

 ## Acknowledgements

 * Code institute tutors for help with problems with my code
 * Friends and family for checking the fuctionality of the website.
